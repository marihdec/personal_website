      "contents": "\nI’ve always been passionate about the environment and being in nature. After finishing my undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies at UCSB, I spent 6 months traveling to Southern Africa and Australia, and I worked a harvest season at a winery in Paso Robles, CA. In so doing, I was lucky to experience aspects of our world that I had never interacted with before. On safari in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Botswana, I got to see elephants, zebras, lions, giraffes, leopards, hyenas, buffalo, and more in their natural habitats. However, I also learned about poaching, habitat destruction, and political unrest in those regions. In Australia, I visited the Great Barrier Reef and, in addition to meeting some interest sea life, I observed the effects of coral bleaching. During my time as a harvest intern at a vineyard in California, I got to learn about organic and biodynamic farming practices and low intervention winemaking techniques, but I also came to realize that these are the norm in most wine producing regions. I saw firsthand the effects of widespread pesticide usage on the surrounding vineyards. These experiences invigorated my desire to work in sustainability and to contribute to the reduction of human impacts on the environment.\nI came to the Bren School because I am interested in the development of sustainable products. Whether its by finding ways to reduce the impacts of apparel materials or through creating biodegradable packaging, I am eager to help make the items that get us through our days more Earth friendly.\n\n\n\nElephants outside our hotel!
