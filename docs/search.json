      "contents": "\nI’ve always been passionate about the environment and being in nature. After finishing my undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies at UCSB, I spent 6 months traveling to Southern Africa and Australia, and I worked a harvest season at a winery in Paso Robles, CA. In so doing, I was lucky to experience aspects of our world that I had never interacted with before. On safari in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Botswana, I got to see elephants, zebras, lions, giraffes, leopards, hyenas, buffalo, and more in their natural habitats. However, I also learned about poaching, habitat destruction, and political unrest in those regions. In Australia, I visited the Great Barrier Reef and, in addition to meeting some interest sea life, I observed the effects of coral bleaching. During my time as a harvest intern at a vineyard in California, I got to learn about organic and biodynamic farming practices and low intervention winemaking techniques, but I also came to realize that these are the norm in most wine producing regions. I saw firsthand the effects of widespread pesticide usage on the surrounding vineyards. These experiences invigorated my desire to work in sustainability and to contribute to the reduction of human impacts on the environment.\nI came to the Bren School because I am interested in the development of sustainable products. Whether it’s by finding ways to reduce the impacts of apparel materials or through creating biodegradable packaging, I am eager to help make the items that get us through the day more Earth friendly!\n\n\n\nElephants outside our hotel!

Since the 1940s, Los Angeles’s Department of Water & Power has been diverting water away from Mono Lake in order to meet the city’s water demands. A study in the 1970s revealed that reducing the level and volume of the lake was resulting in ecological damage affecting the native wildlife including California Gulls, Eared Grebes, Osprey, and Brine Shrimp, among many others. The students who conducted the study founded the Mono Lake Committee (MLC) with the goal of saving this ecosystem and have been recording and reporting on the lake’s conditions ever since. In the 2017 Mono Basin Stream Restoration Agreement (MBSRA) was approved, but has not yet implemented by DWP. The green line indicates the lake level that the CA State Water Board mandated must be maintained for the lake to be stable (6,392 feet). The yellow line indicates the level at which land bridges emerge that allow coyotes to prey on nesting birds (6,377 feet above sea level). The orange line indicates the level at which salinity is high enough to reduce brine shrimp populations that many native birds rely on (120 g/L at 6,360 feet above sea level). Point labels indicate significant historical events affecting Mono Lake.\n\n\n\n",
