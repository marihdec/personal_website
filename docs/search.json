      "contents": "\nI’ve always been passionate about the environment and being in\nnature. After finishing my undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies\nat UCSB, I spent 6 months traveling to Southern Africa and Australia,\nand I worked a harvest season at a winery in Paso Robles, CA. In so\ndoing, I was lucky to experience aspects of our world that I had never\ninteracted with before. On safari in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia,\nand Botswana, I got to see elephants, zebras, lions, giraffes, leopards,\nhyenas, buffalo, and more in their natural habitats. However, I also\nlearned about poaching, habitat destruction, and political unrest in\nthose regions. In Australia, I visited the Great Barrier Reef and, in\naddition to meeting some interest sea life, I observed the effects of\ncoral bleaching. During my time as a harvest intern at a vineyard in\nCalifornia, I got to learn about organic and biodynamic farming\npractices and low intervention winemaking techniques, but I also came to\nrealize that these are the norm in most wine producing regions. I saw\nfirsthand the effects of widespread pesticide usage on the surrounding\nvineyards. These experiences invigorated my desire to work in\nsustainability and to contribute to the reduction of human impacts on\nthe environment.\nI came to the Bren School because I am interested in the development\nof sustainable products. Whether it’s by finding ways to reduce the\nimpacts of apparel materials or through creating biodegradable\npackaging, I am eager to help make the items that get us through the day\nmore Earth friendly!\n\n\n\nElephants outside our hotel!
